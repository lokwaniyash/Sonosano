# to the people asking: ts ain't dead, I am still working on it. and not just soulseek or bittorrent, we're gonna make the most accessible P2P file sharing network which won't limited by the profoundly evil CGNAT. Plz don't make any PRs rn. some people might not like... that this app becomes something new with every update, but it remains the same at the end of the day - a P2P song player.

# FAQ

**Does this app stream from peers?**

> No, It does not stream from peers, it streams from the user himself after the file is saved.

---

**Will there only be one P2P source?**

> No, making it a large P2P source aggregator is the grand plan.

---

**Which files does this app reshare back to the P2P network?**

> Every single one of the file that you download or put in your library gets reshared back.

---

**How is it different from any other P2P client?**

> It's not, infact, it uses well known and maintained Nicotine+ in backend.

---

**Can it replace my current music streaming service/provider?**

> No, this is not a replacement, they are simply a lot more convenient, thats why only enthusiasts actually stick around.

---

**How accurate is the fake flac analyser?**

> The algo works well with low effort fake flac (which are the most popular type of fakes) and fails with old files but, it just tags the audio and doesn't actually remove them so that you can see for yourself too.

---

**How big is the library?**

> Depends. larger than any other service, but you might find things there that you can't here.

---

**Do I have to setup anything else to use the app?**

> No, besides network requirments, its standalone.

---

**What does Sonosano mean?**

> Pure/healthy Sound, name inspired from 20th century grape bricks.

# Contributing

### Read this before contributing

- **Backend-First Approach:** All the core logic, tasks go in python backend, electron is just for UI and nothing else.

- **Safety:** Do not mention or hardcode references to specific commercial music services in the code, UI text, or documentation except the ones I did (I'll remove it later anyways). The application should remain a generic music discovery and management tool.

- **UI & UX Consistency:** This is a very familiar UI, so you already know where to take the designs from.

- **Code Quality:** Follow the existing coding style and conventions. Use TypeScript for the frontend and Python type hints for the backend to maintain code quality and clarity. Add comments for any complex logic.

### `I.` — The Nature of the Tool

> It is important to note—this application is not a content service providing you with files, but a **tool**—a simple client for accessing peer-to-peer networks.

> It is not a curated library filled by us—but a **gateway** to a vast, user-driven ecosystem filled by others.

> I do not host, provide, or endorse any of the content you may find—this is not a repository holding data, but merely a **conduit**—connecting you to it.

---

### `II.` — The Burden of the User

> As a result—the responsibility for your actions does not lie with the developers, but rests solely and entirely upon **YOU**—and you alone.

> This application is not a shield from copyright law—but a powerful instrument that demands _your_ own strict legal compliance within _your_ jurisdiction.

> I am not the arbiters of your downloads—but you are the final and only judge of your own conduct. Every search, every download, every share—is not our decision, but yours.

---

### `III.` — The Inevitable Conclusion

> In the event of any consequence—legal or otherwise—liability is not a shared concept that I partake in, but a personal burden you accept in full by using this software.

> In conclusion—this is not an invitation to act without thought, but an explicit **demand** that you act with full awareness of your own responsibilities.
